# Primordium : The Evolution of Genetic Robustness for Cellular Cooperation in Early Multicellular Organisms 

This repository holds the source code, configuration scripts, analyses, and assembled supplemental material for the ALife 2022 conference submission "The Evolution of Genetic Robustness for Cellular Cooperation in Early
Multicellular Organisms"

Supplemental material is best viewed here: https://anonymousalifer.github.io/primordium_supplement/
The interactive webapp is available here: https://anonymousalifer.github.io/primordium_webapp/

## Navigation
- `./application` contains all source code for the project
- `./docs/replication.md` gives instructions for how to compile the project
- `./experiments` holds the configuration scripts and data for each experiment, as well as the tools to easily run experiments on a Slurm job-scheduling system
- `./supplemental_material` holds the source for the supplemental material, but the material itself is best viewed compiled: https://anonymousalifer.github.io/primordium_supplement/
- `./web` is a placeholder directory to hold the compiled web app.
