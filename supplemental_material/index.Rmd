# Introduction

This document serves as the supplemental material for the ALife 2022 conference submission "The Evolution of Genetic Robustness for Cellular Cooperation in Early".

## Overview

The document is split into sections that are accessible via the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. 
Each section corresponds to an experiment (some that were discussed at length in the paper, others that were briefly mentioned).
As such, each section follows the same formula: setup, plots, and statistics. 

## Interactive web app 

To build intuition on how organisms fill, we created an interactive web app, available here: https://anonymousalifer.github.io/primordium_webapp/
